<p>Baseball has always been a numbers game. Whether it be batting average, earned run average, or wins above replacement, players’ in-game statistics dictate nearly every management decision, as small as a call to the bullpen and as big as releasing a player. Although these in-game statistics can be very telling on a player-by-player basis, they are not always indicative of a team’s success as a whole.</p>

<p>#Need to make above table more user-friendly and readable#</p>
<p>One of the most significant divisions between teams are they’re relative payrolls. The wealthiest teams in the league often can have as high as four times the funds of the poorest teams for any given season. Surely, an inequality gap this massive must have a noteworthy impact on teams’ success relative to one another; however, the influence of this resource gap is not as straightforward as one might think.</p>
<p>Our initial and obvious instinct was that teams’ winning percentage should increase as their payroll increases, and that certainly holds true, as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A team with even a two-fold increase of payroll should be expected to drastically outperform the lower spending teams. However, the above graph tells us that, on average, a $1 million increase in payroll can only be expected to result in a 0.06% in win percentage. That means that an extra $1 million cannot even buy a single win. In a 164-game season, 1 win makes a difference in win percentage of approximately 0.6%. Combined with the results of the graph above, 1 win would cost approximately $10 million dollars on account of payroll alone.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team with the highest winning percentage between 2000 and 2016 had a payroll of less than $100 million. Although this point of observation may simplify qualify as an outlier, it is important to note that payroll is not explicitly indicative of success, as many low-payroll teams have been able to overcome this obstacle. As well, if we investigate these trends on a team by team basis, the results are not consistent:</p>
<p>The above results tell us that for just about half of the teams in the MLB, as payroll increases, their winning percentages actually decrease, which is hard to imagine. As a team gains funding, shouldn’t they be spending more money on better talent, which would in theory produce better results? The peculiarities of this plot indicate a more nuanced pattern underlying teams’ success in the MLB.</p>
<p>To further investigate, we should try to correlate payroll with other metrics. We begin by looking at offensive statistics such as hits:</p>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
#Want to make above graph more readable for this page#</p>
<p>To our surprise, with the exception of a <em>handful</em> of teams, hits actually to decrease as payroll increases, and in fact, the same goes for homeruns:</p>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
#Also want to make more readable#</p>
<p>From these two plots, we can infer that teams clearly are not allocating any additional funds they receive to their offensive players. So where, then, is all of this money going? And why are additional funds generally detracting from offensive production and not adding or even remaining stagnant? To answer these questions, we next must investigate defensive trends to see if that might clue us in the right direction.</p>
<p>Our initial thought when seeing this broad decrease in offense was to check pitching performance, as any decrease in offense is most certainly a benefit to pitchers, as their metrics are complementary to one another. To test this, we plot strikeouts vs payroll and assess the results:</p>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/big_picture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />
#Also need to make more readable^#</p>
<p>Eureka! 29 of 30 teams in the MLB demonstrate a clear increase in total strikeouts per year as payroll increases. Without the offensive analysis prior to this, this result seems intuitively obvious. But now it is relatively clear that, for the vast majority of teams, any increases in payroll tend to fund the pitching staff rather than the offense.</p>
<p>In addition to telling us the destination of teams’ funding, the above result is somewhat explanative of the decreases in offense we observed earlier. If teams are consistently directing more resources to their pitching staffs, pitchers will in turn consistently dominate batters, weakening teams’ overall offensive statistics.</p>

<p>Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn’t assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.</p>

<h2>Rubric: Other components</h2>
<div id="interactive" class="section level3">
<h3>Interactive</h3>
<p>You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like <a href="/flex/flex.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor’s approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!</li>

<div id="video-recording" class="section level3">
<h3>Video Recording</h3>
<p>Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.

Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
