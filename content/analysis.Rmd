We describe here our detailed data analysis.

## Data Analysis Motivations

For our data analysis, we are most interested in the relationship between the `win_perc` variable in our `win_perc` data set we created, which can be found in our Data page, and the `payroll` variable from our `mlb_payroll` dataset. We wish to look at the whether a particular team's winning percentage changes each season with that team's payroll. Does a high payroll correspond with more wins and therefore higher success? If so, where do the dollars from an increase in the payroll go? If not, what factors lead to a team losing even with such high payrolls?

```{r loading, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
load(here::here("dataset", "win_perc.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset", "mlb_payroll.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset", "baseball.RData"))
```

## Initial Analysis

To begin, we looked at the relationship between payrolls and the winning percentage for a certain season and team. 
\
```{r payroll_win_model}
payroll_win <- win_perc %>% left_join(mlb_payroll, by = c("year", "h_name")) %>% filter(!is.na(payroll))
(payroll_mod <- lm(win_perc ~ log(payroll), data = payroll_win))
beta <- coef(payroll_mod)

# for all teams, as payroll increases, winning percentage for a given year increases
ggplot(payroll_win) + geom_point(aes(log(payroll), win_perc, color = h_name)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = beta[1], slope = beta[2], color = "red")
```
\
From the model, we see the coefficient for the log(payroll) is positive suggesting a positive relationship between payroll and winning percentage. We can also see this relationship in the plot. Overall, as log(payroll) increases, winning percentage increases.\
\
We then faceted by team to observe the relationship between payroll and winning percentage for each team.\
\

```{r payroll_win_facet}
#faceted
ggplot(payroll_win,aes(log(payroll),win_perc))+geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5)+
                                            geom_smooth(method='lm', color = "red", lwd = 0.8)+
                                            facet_wrap(vars(h_name))
```
\
From these faceted plots, it is not consistent among all teams that as payroll increases, winning percentage also increases. For about half of the teams, including teams like the Chicago White Sox (`CHA`) and the Oakland Athletics (`OAK`), as payroll increases, their winning percentage for that year decreases.\
\
In our analyses that follow, we look at what factors influence this divide between a positive and negative relationship between payroll and winning percentage.\
\

## Positive Relationship

When analyzing the positive relationship between payroll and winning percentage, we wanted to look at the relationships between payroll and certain game statistics for each season. We first looked at payroll and hits to see if an increase in the number of hits per season was influencing this positive relationship. To do this, we calculated the total hits for each team each year by summing their home hits and their away hits. We then joined this dataset with the `mlb_payroll` dataset and plotted `total_hits` against `log(payroll)`.\
\
```{r payroll_hits}
#home hits per team per year
h_hits <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, h_hits) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_hits = sum(h_hits))
#visiting hits per team per year
v_hits <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, v_hits) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_hits = sum(v_hits))
#join and total hits per team per year
total_hits <- h_hits %>% left_join(v_hits, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_hits = h_hits + v_hits)
#join with mlb_payroll
payroll_hits <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_hits, by = c("year", "h_name"))
```

```{r payroll_hits_plot}
#for each team
payroll_hits %>% filter(!is.na(total_hits)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_hits)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name))
```
\
To our surprise, for most teams, as payroll increases, the total number of hits in a season decreases. This suggests that even though teams are spending more money on more valuable players, their offensive performance in their total hits for a season does not increase.\
\
We then looked at the relationships between payroll and homeruns for each season. It is possible that teams are spending more money on players known for hitting home runs and therefore bring in more runs rather than players who just hit and get on base without bringing in a run. We first calculated the total home runs for each team each year by summing their home home runs and their away home runs. We then joined this dataset with the `mlb_payroll` dataset and plotted `total_hits` against `log(payroll)`.\
\
```{r payroll_homeruns}
h_hruns <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, h_homeruns) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_hruns = sum(h_homeruns))
#visiting hits per team per year
v_hruns <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, v_homeruns) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_hruns = sum(v_homeruns))
#join and total hits per team per year
total_hruns <- h_hruns %>% left_join(v_hruns, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_hruns = h_hruns + v_hruns)
#join with mlb_payroll
payroll_hruns <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_hruns, by = c("year", "h_name"))
```

```{r payroll_homeruns_plot}
#for each team
payroll_hruns %>% filter(!is.na(total_hruns)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_hruns)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name))
```
\
Again, to our surprise most teams produced fewer home runs as payroll increased. From these graphs on the relationships between payroll and hits and payroll and home runs, it appears as though the offensive performance does not improve. So what then are these teams spending money on to increase their winning percentage?\
\
Rather than looking at offensive performance, we looked at defensive performance, particularly pitching. The first statistic we looked at for pitchers was strikeouts. In the `baseball` dataset, the variables `h_strikeouts` and `v_strikeouts` refer to the total number of times players struckout for the home team and visiting team respectively. To make this a statistic for the home team and visiting team pitchers, we reversed their variables. More explicitly, the total strikeouts for the home team pitchers is represented by the visiting team's strikeouts (`v_strikeouts`) and the total strikeouts for the visiting team pitchers is represented by the home team's strikeouts(`h_strikeouts`). We calculated the total strikeouts for each team for each year, joined this dataset with the `mlb_payroll` dataset, and plotted the total strikeouts against `log(payroll)`.\
\

```{r payroll_so}
#home hits per team per year
h_so <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, v_strikeouts) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_so = sum(v_strikeouts))
#visiting hits per team per year
v_so <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, h_strikeouts) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_so = sum(h_strikeouts))
#join and total hits per team per year
total_so <- h_so %>% left_join(v_so, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_so = h_so + v_so)
#join with mlb_payroll
payroll_so <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_so, by = c("year", "h_name"))
```

```{r payroll_so_plot}
#for each team
payroll_so %>% filter(!is.na(total_so)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_so)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name))
```
\
These plots show that for almost all of the teams, as payroll increases, the total number of strikeouts performed by the pitchers of each team also increases. We then looked at the earned runs statistic to see if this change in pitcher performance was consistent with the increase in payroll. Similar to the strikeout variables, `h_team_earned_runs` and `v_team_earned_runs` are the earned runs for the players of the home team and visiting team respectively. Here again we represented the earned runs for the home team pitchers with `v_team_earned_runs` and represented the earned runs for the visiting team pitchers with `h_team_earned_runs`. We calculated the total earned runs for each team for each year, joined this dataset with the `mlb_payroll` dataset, and plotted the total earned runs against `log(payroll)`.\
\

```{r payroll_er}
#home hits per team per year
h_er <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, v_team_earned_runs) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_er = sum(v_team_earned_runs))
#visiting hits per team per year
v_er <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, h_team_earned_runs) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_er = sum(h_team_earned_runs))
#join and total hits per team per year
total_er <- h_er %>% left_join(v_er, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_er = h_er + v_er)
#join with mlb_payroll
payroll_er <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_er, by = c("year", "h_name"))
```

```{r payroll_er_plot}
#for each team
payroll_er %>% filter(!is.na(total_er)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_er)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name))
```
\
According to the plots, as payroll increases, the total earned runs for most teams decreases. These faceted plots along with the plots for total strikeouts against payroll suggest that along with an increase in payroll, the performance of the pitching improves with more strikeouts and less earned runs against the pitchers.\
