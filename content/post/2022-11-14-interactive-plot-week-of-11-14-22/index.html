<p>For our interactive, we want to put the geographic location of all of the stadiums onto a map of the United States, colored by division. This was a good contribution to the website because it provides context and When you click on a stadium, the team name and winning percentage of games played will pop up. Using the drop down menu, you can select one year for the winning percentages to be displayed from.</p>
<p>The personalized aspect will be how the user has the ability to choose a stadium; they will be able to investigate the statistics for their favorite teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our rough outline of our interactive is shown below. We still need to convert to Shiny.</li>
