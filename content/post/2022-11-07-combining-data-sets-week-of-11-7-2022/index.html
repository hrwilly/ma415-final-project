<p>One of the requirements for your project is that you bring together multiple datasets to enable a more in depth analysis. This could be including weather data based on dates, including demographic data based on location, among many other possibilities.
For this week’s blog post, please describe the datasets you are combining, how you are combining them, and what your initial findings were. Also, were there any difficulties in combining the data? If you haven’t finished combining datasets, that is fine, just discuss where you are in the process and what your next steps are.</p>
<p>We are combining the baseball data with weather, to see if factors such as wind speed and temperature affect a win. The dataset we found for weather is separated by date, and gives the high, low, and average values for multiple different factors. This specific dataset only has data for Boston, but we plan on adding other locations later on when we analyze more teams.</p>
