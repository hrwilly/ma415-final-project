To wrap up our data analysis, we are doing summary statistics of _____, as well as expanding on our model of _____.We are also adding more of a variety of plots, like ____.


The overall question we are answering is "Does a higher payroll correspond with more wins, and therefore higher success?". Throughout our analysis, we have found a variability in the answer between teams.
