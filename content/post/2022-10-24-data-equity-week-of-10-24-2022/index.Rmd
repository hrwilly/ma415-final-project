Beneficence: be transparent about limits of data

Justice: Return data and research results to community members in a form they can use

Respect for persons: Be transparent about what the plans are for the data after the project concludes

Please read the this article on Data for Equity Principals. While all aspects of this are not relevant for your projects, and the relevance may vary for depending on your chosen data sets, there are some important things to think about in general about collecting and working with data.

Discuss how the principles for advancing equitable data practice are relevant to your data. I realize that many of the principles require interaction with communities but think about how the principles could be applied if possible.
For two or three of principles, talk about how they are relevant and what adhering to the practice would entail for your data.
A particularly important principle is transparency. Talk about what might be some limitations of your analysis.
Discuss the potential for abuse or misuse of the data.
