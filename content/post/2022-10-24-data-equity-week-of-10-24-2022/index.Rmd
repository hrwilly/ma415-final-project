Beneficence: be transparent about limits of data

Our data has been collected by the MLB over a long historical period. Although we will be exclusively using data relevant to the past ten years, we are limited to the reporting of the MLB. Errors in data from imprecise collection limit our ability to be precise. Similarly, we are limited in weather data to the precision and breadth of weather data provide for each city. Our analysis will also only be made using formal baseball statistics relevant to the rules of the game. Additional factors outside of game data and weather such as random stadium factors will not be a part of our analysis. 

Justice: Return data and research results to community members in a form they can use



Please read the this article on Data for Equity Principals. While all aspects of this are not relevant for your projects, and the relevance may vary for depending on your chosen data sets, there are some important things to think about in general about collecting and working with data.

Discuss how the principles for advancing equitable data practice are relevant to your data. I realize that many of the principles require interaction with communities but think about how the principles could be applied if possible.
For two or three of principles, talk about how they are relevant and what adhering to the practice would entail for your data.
A particularly important principle is transparency. Talk about what might be some limitations of your analysis.
Discuss the potential for abuse or misuse of the data.
