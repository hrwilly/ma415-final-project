Beneficence: be transparent about limits of data

Our data has been collected by the MLB over a long historical period. Although we will be exclusively using data relevant to the past ten years, we are limited to the reporting of the MLB. Our analysis will be restricted to only a handful of home team stadiums, limiting our report to the teams outcomes only at home. Our weather considerations are limited to the precision of weather reports for major home team stadiums. Because we will be collecting weather data from the city as a whole, it may not be the most accurate representation of the exact weather conditions at the stadium. Additional factors outside of game data and weather such as random stadium factors will not be a part of our analysis. 

Justice: Return data and research results to community members in a form they can use



Please read the this article on Data for Equity Principals. While all aspects of this are not relevant for your projects, and the relevance may vary for depending on your chosen data sets, there are some important things to think about in general about collecting and working with data.

Discuss how the principles for advancing equitable data practice are relevant to your data. I realize that many of the principles require interaction with communities but think about how the principles could be applied if possible.
For two or three of principles, talk about how they are relevant and what adhering to the practice would entail for your data.
A particularly important principle is transparency. Talk about what might be some limitations of your analysis.
Discuss the potential for abuse or misuse of the data.
