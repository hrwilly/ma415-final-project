Two graphs EDA, one modeling graph

Graph #1 - Truly Exploratory Data: 
Potential Exploration: 
 - Day vs Night games?
 - If winning momntum or losing momentum exists, ei. does a previously lost game make u more     likely to lose?
 

Graph #2 - An experiment in the accuracy of the Pythagorean Winning Percentage (PWP)

$$Pythagroean\ Winning\ Percentage = runs\ scored\ ^{2} / (run\ scored\ ^{2} + runs\ allowed\  ^{2})$$
Compare the PWP to the actual winning percentage of the team. 
 - create winning percentage column: mutate(if(h_score>v_score) add column = win or TRUE )
      do a similar mutation for losses, and sum the wins divided by total 
 - Pythagorean column: baseball %>% mutate(pwp = h_score^2 / (h_score^2 + v_score^2))  
 - group by team and filter for only one team
 - plot one teams pwd vs year, and the actual winning percentage per year or season 
 
 missing a group my season or group  by year (however baseball works) in here somewhere 
      
Graph #3 - A logistical model predicting wins or losses
