<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>First, make sure to read the Data page on your website. Particularly, the section on “Where to keep data?“.
One correction: If you have a dataset &gt;50mb, you’ll need to name the folder dataset-ignore, not dataset_ignore.
Discuss any initial steps you are taking to load and clean the data.
If you are working with a large data set, you might decide to start with a subset of the data. How did you choose this?
Are you starting by removing missing values or focusing on columns with less missing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Talk about your initial exploration of the data.
Give summary statistics and make plots about parts of the data that will be your focus. You might focus on just a few variables.
What are the big, obvious patterns in the data? Are these surprising?</p>
