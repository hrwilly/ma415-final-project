## Data Set 1

## Data Set 2

This data set provides information for each year 2013-2020 on prescription drugs, their prescription patterns, cost, beneficiaries, and more at both the federal and state level. One of the most immediate challenges would certainly be understanding some of the column titles like 'LIS_Bene_Cst_Shr'. As well, if we wanted to correlate these prescription patterns with broader trends, it would be difficult to decide what sort of social factors may be impacting; even then, correlation != causation.


## Data Set 3

Link to data set: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dhs-data-dashboard 

This is a data set describing the reported sheltered homeless individuals in NYC over a period of seven years at intervals of several months. It provides data about ademographics and is collected by a federal agency.
