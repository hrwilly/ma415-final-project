## Baseball Game Logs

The main dataset used in our analysis of factors that influence a win among Major League Baseball teams is the Baseball Game Logs from 1871-2016 which is a dataset that can be found on the Data.World website. This dataset was compiled from 127 separate CSV files from [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org), a website dedicated to providing as many play-by-play accounts of major league games as possible. Many people have contributed to providing the game logs, however, baseball historian Bob Tiemann is credited with originating the logs and Arnie Braunstein is credited with computerizing them. The data from Retrosheet was collected for the purpose of providing fans access to data that allows them to compare player and team performances to other years. 

### Variables

Provided in the table below are a list of all the relevant variables used in our analysis.

```{r game_logs_variables, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(
  Variable = c("date",
               "day_of_week",
               "v_name",
               "h_name",
               "v_score",
               "h_score",
               "day_night",
               "park_id",
               "winning_pitcher_name",
               "v_starting_pitcher_name",
               "h_starting_pitcher_name"),
  Type = c("date",
           "string",
           "string",
           "string",
           "integer",
           "integer",
           "string",
           "string",
           "string",
           "string",
           "string"),
  Description = c("Date of game played",
                  "Day of week game was played",
                  "Visiting team name",
                  "Home team name",
                  "Visiting team score",
                  "Home team score",
                  'Day/Night indicator ("D" or "N")',
                  "Park ID of location of game played",
                  "Name of winning pitcher",
                  "Visiting team starting pitcher name",
                  "Home team starting pitcher name")
        
) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Georgia") %>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center") %>% 
  column_spec(column = c(1,2,3), background = "#F0F8FF")

```

The remaining variables of the game logs datasest include the names of the starting position players for both the home and visiting teams as well as statistics for each team of the game including hits, walks, rbi's, errors, and double plays. 

### Cleaning

A link to our `load_and_clean_data.R` file can be found [here](/load_and_clean_data.R).\
\
This dataset is >50mb and can therefore be found in our `dataset-ignore` folder. After reading in the CSV file, we specified the column types for variables `forfeit` and `completion` to remove any problems. We converted the dataset into a tibble and saved it under the variable `baseball`.\
\
Our next step in cleaning the data was to take the date as an integer and separate it into three columns: `year`, `month`, and `day`.\
\
Due to the largeness of the dataset as well as significant missing data from the 1970s and 1990s, we chose to work with more recent years and so filtered the data to only include those baseball games that took place between the years 2000 and 2016.\
\
The next step in cleaning our `baseball` dataset was to mutate a column titled `score_diff`. `v_score` and `h_score` provides the number of runs scored by each team, but the dataset does not include a variable that states which team won a given game. `score_diff` takes the number of the visiting team's runs subtracted from the number of the home team's runs. A positive value represents a win for the home team, a negative value represents a loss, and a zero is a tie. The higher absolute value of `score_diff` represents a larger win or loss.\
\
Lastly, we replaced all team names of `MON` with `WAS` and `FLO` with `MIA`. The Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005 and the Florida Marlins became the Miami Marlins in 2012. This prevents the split of each team into two teams with missing data.\
\
This cleaned `baseball` dataset can be found in the `dataset` folder. 

### Winning Percentage

Another variable not included in the game logs dataset that would useful in our analyses is that of winning percentage. Winning percentage is the percentage of games played that resulted in a win for a given team and given season. The following code calculates the winning percentage for each team and year from 2000 to 2016. This code can also be found in the `load_and_clean_data.R` where the data is saved in `win_perc.RData`.

*Only the first 20 rows of the data table are shown for concision
```{r win_perc, echo=FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset", "baseball.RData"))
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)

#win/loss column (1 = win, 0 = loss or tie)
h_win_loss <- function(h, v) {
  ifelse(h > v, 1, 0)
}
baseball <- baseball %>% mutate(h_win_loss = h_win_loss(h_score, v_score))
```
```{r}
knitr::kable(baseball[1:20,])
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
#total games won
home_wins <- baseball %>% group_by(h_name, year) %>% summarize(h_wins = sum(h_win_loss == 1))
away_wins <- baseball %>% group_by(v_name, year) %>% summarize(a_wins = sum(h_win_loss == 0))
team_year_wins <- home_wins %>% add_column(a_wins = away_wins$a_wins) %>% 
  mutate(games_won = h_wins + a_wins)

#total games played
home_games <- baseball %>% group_by(h_name, year) %>% summarize(home_games = n())
away_games <- baseball %>% group_by(v_name, year) %>% summarize(away_games = n())
win_perc <- home_games %>% add_column(away_games = away_games$away_games) %>% 
  mutate(games_played = home_games + away_games) %>% 
  add_column(games_won = team_year_wins$games_won) %>% 
  mutate(win_perc = games_won/games_played)
```

## MLB Team Payrolls
In order to analyze the effects of teams' payrolls on their winning percentage each season, we compiled a CSV file based on data found from the "MLB Team Payrolls" link found in our `DATASETS` table. The website itself did not contain any easily downloadable data file, so we copied the columns `Team`, `Rank`, and `Total (Payroll)` from the years 2000-2016 into a CSV file, adding a column indicating the year for each observation. It is important to note that not each year has consistent column names on the website, so we consistently interpreted the highest value payroll columns as the `Total` payroll values. Additionally, since not each year had a `Rank` column, we manually observed and added `Rank` values for those that were missing. Lastly, we adjusted the team names to match our main dataset's unique h_name abbreviations. This csv file can be found in our dataset folder.\
\
We combined this dataset with the `win_perc` dataset by first converting the `year` variable from type double to character type. This code can be found in the `load_and_clean_data.R` where the data is saved in `mlb_payroll.RData`.\
\
We then joined `mlb_payroll` with `win_perc` to get our final payroll tibble.\
\

```{r payroll, echo=FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset", "mlb_payroll.RData"))

pay_tibble <- win_perc %>% 
  left_join(mlb_payroll, by = c('year'='year', 'h_name'='h_name')) %>% 
  arrange(year)

pay_tibble %>% kable(align = "c") %>% 
  column_spec(column = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), background = "#F0F8FF") %>% 
  kable_paper(full_width = TRUE) %>% 
  kable_classic_2(html_font = "Georgia") %>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```
