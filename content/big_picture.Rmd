Baseball has always been a numbers game. Whether it be batting average, earned run average, or wins above replacement, players' in-game statistics dictate nearly every management decision, as small as a call to the bullpen and as big as releasing a player. Although these in-game statistics can be very telling on a player-by-player basis, they are not always indicative of a team's success as a whole.

One of the most significant divisions between teams are they're relative payrolls. The wealthiest teams in the league often can have as high as four times the funds of the poorest teams for any given season. Surely, an inequality gap this massive must have a noteworthy impact on teams' success relative to one another; however, the influence of this resource gap is not as straightforward as one might think. 

Our initial and obvious instinct was that teams' winning percentage should increase as their payroll increases, and that certainly holds true, as shown in the figure below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
payroll_win <- win_perc %>% left_join(mlb_payroll, by = c("year", "h_name")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(payroll))

payroll_win$payroll <- round(payroll_win$payroll/1e6)

payroll_mod <- lm(win_perc ~ payroll, data = payroll_win)

beta <- coef(payroll_mod)

payroll_mod <- lm(win_perc ~ payroll, data = payroll_win)
payroll_win %>% ggplot(aes(payroll, win_perc)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = h_name)) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", lwd =0.5) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Team") +
  labs(x = "Payroll (million)", 
       y = "Winning Percentage", 
       title = "Relationship Between Winning Percentage and Payroll for the 30 MLB Teams") +
  geom_label(aes(x = 30, y = 72, label = paste("slope = 0.06")))

```

A team with even a two-fold increase of payroll should be expected to drastically outperform the lower spending teams. However, the above graph tells us that, on average, a \$1 million increase in payroll can only be expected to result in a 0.06% in win percentage. That means that an extra \$1 million cannot even buy a single win. In a 164-game season, 1 win makes a difference in win percentage of approximately 0.6%. Combined with the results of the graph above, 1 win would cost approximately \$10 million dollars on account of payroll alone. 

Additionally, the team with the highest winning percentage between 2000 and 2016 had a payroll of less than \$100 million. Although this point of observation may simplify qualify as an outlier, it is important to note that payroll is not explicitly indicative of success, as many low-payroll teams have been able to overcome this obstacle. As well, if we investigate these trends on a team by team basis, the results are not consistent:

```{r echo=FALSE}
slopes <-  payroll_win %>% select(h_name, payroll, win_perc) %>% 
  nest(data = -h_name) %>%
  mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(win_perc ~ payroll, data = .)),
     tidied = map(model, tidy)) %>%
  unnest(tidied) %>% 
  filter(term == "payroll") %>%
  arrange(desc(estimate)) %>%
  select(h_name, estimate, std.error, p.value)

slopes$estimate <- round(slopes$estimate, digits = 4)
slopes$std.error <- round(slopes$std.error, digits = 3)
slopes$p.value <- round(slopes$p.value, digits = 2)


coefs_bar <- slopes %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(h_name, -estimate), y = estimate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = estimate)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(high = "#152238", low = "#BCD2E8") +
  labs(x = "Teams", y = "Slope", title = "Increase in Win Percentage per $1 million Payroll Increease") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=2))
```

The above results tell us that for just about half of the teams in the MLB, as payroll increases, their winning percentages actually decrease, which is hard to imagine. As a team gains funding, shouldn't they be spending more money on better talent, which would in theory produce better results? The peculiarities of this plot indicate a more nuanced pattern underlying teams' success in the MLB. 

To further investigate, we should try to correlate payroll with other metrics. We begin by looking at offensive statistics such as hits:

```{r echo=FALSE}
h_hits <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, h_hits) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_hits = sum(h_hits))

v_hits <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, v_hits) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_hits = sum(v_hits))

total_hits <- h_hits %>% left_join(v_hits, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_hits = h_hits + v_hits)

payroll_hits <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_hits, by = c("year", "h_name"))

payroll_hits %>% filter(!is.na(total_hits)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_hits)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + labs(x = "Hits", y = "Payroll") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name))
```

To our surprise, with the exception of a *handful* of teams, hits actually to decrease as payroll increases, and in fact, the same goes for homeruns:

```{r echo=FALSE}
h_hruns <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, h_homeruns) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_hruns = sum(h_homeruns))

v_hruns <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, v_homeruns) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_hruns = sum(v_homeruns))

total_hruns <- h_hruns %>% left_join(v_hruns, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_hruns = h_hruns + v_hruns)

payroll_hruns <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_hruns, by = c("year", "h_name"))

payroll_hruns %>% filter(!is.na(total_hruns)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_hruns)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name)) + labs(x = "Homeruns", y = "Payroll")
```

From these two plots, we can infer that teams clearly are not allocating any additional funds they receive to their offensive players. So where, then, is all of this money going? And why are additional funds generally detracting from offensive production and not adding or even remaining stagnant? To answer these questions, we next must investigate defensive trends to see if that might clue us in the right direction.

Our initial thought when seeing this broad decrease in offense was to check pitching performance, as any decrease in offense is most certainly a benefit to pitchers, as their metrics are complementary to one another. To test this, we plot strikeouts vs payroll and assess the results:

```{r echo=FALSE}
h_so <- baseball %>% select(year, h_name, v_strikeouts) %>% 
  group_by(year,h_name) %>% 
  summarize(h_so = sum(v_strikeouts))

v_so <- baseball %>% select(year, v_name, h_strikeouts) %>% 
  group_by(year,v_name) %>% 
  summarize(v_so = sum(h_strikeouts))

total_so <- h_so %>% left_join(v_so, by = c("year" = "year", "h_name" = "v_name")) %>% 
  mutate(total_so = h_so + v_so)

payroll_so <- mlb_payroll %>% left_join(total_so, by = c("year", "h_name"))

payroll_so %>% filter(!is.na(total_so)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log(payroll), total_so)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", lwd = 0.8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(h_name)) + labs(x = "Strikeouts", y = "Payroll")
```
#Also need to make more readable^#

Eureka! 29 of 30 teams in the MLB demonstrate a clear increase in total strikeouts per year as payroll increases. Without the offensive analysis prior to this, this result seems intuitively obvious. But now it is relatively clear that, for the vast majority of teams, any increases in payroll tend to fund the pitching staff rather than the offense.

In addition to telling us the destination of teams' funding, the above result is somewhat explanative of the decreases in offense we observed earlier. If teams are consistently directing more resources to their pitching staffs, pitchers will in turn consistently dominate batters, weakening teams' overall offensive statistics.
