This comes from the file `content/big_picture.Rmd`.

Baseball has always been a numbers game. Whether it be batting average, earned run average, or wins above replacement, players' in-game statistics dictate nearly every management decision, as small as a call to the bullpen and as big as releasing a player. Although these in-game statistics can be very telling on a player-by-player basis, they are not always indicative of a team's success as a whole.

One of the most significant divisions between teams are they're relative payrolls. The wealthiest teams in the league often can have as high as four times the funds of the poorest teams for any given season. Surely, an inequality gap this massive must have a noteworthy impact on teams' success relative to one another; however, the influence of this resource gap is not as straightforward as one might think. 

Our initial and obvious instinct was that teams' winning percentage should increase as their payroll increases, and that certainly holds true, as shown in the figure below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
payroll_win <- win_perc %>% left_join(mlb_payroll, by = c("year", "h_name")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(payroll))

payroll_win$payroll <- round(payroll_win$payroll/1e6)

beta <- coef(payroll_mod)

payroll_mod <- lm(win_perc ~ payroll, data = payroll_win)
payroll_win %>% ggplot(aes(payroll, win_perc)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = h_name)) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", lwd =0.5) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Team") +
  labs(x = "Payroll (million)", 
       y = "Winning Percentage", 
       title = "Relationship Between Winning Percentage and Payroll for the 30 MLB Teams") +
  geom_label(aes(x = 30, y = 72, label = paste("slope = 0.06")))

```

A team with even a two-fold increase of payroll should be expected to drastically outperform the lower spending teams. However, the above graph tells us that, on average, a \$1 million increase in payroll can only be expected to result in a 0.06% in win percentage. That means that an extra \$1 million cannot even buy a single win. In a 164-game season, 1 win makes a difference in win percentage of approximately 0.6%. Combined with the results of the graph above, 1 win would cost approximately \$10 million dollars on account of payroll alone. 

However the above plot also has a lot of noise. The team with the highest winning percentage between 2000 and 2016 had a payroll of less than \$100 million. All this noise indicates a more nuanced pattern underlying teams' relative success in the MLB.






Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will



* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-baity title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible).
* Quality of Figures
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `echo=FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!


### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
